}}{{ARGS["top-header"]}}# Container sample: Run a simple application

Type the following command to run a sample console application with Docker:

```console
docker run --rm mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/samples:dotnetapp
```

{{ARGS["top-header"]}}# Container sample: Run a web application

Type the following command to run a sample web application with Docker:

```console
docker run -it --rm -p 8000:80 --name aspnet_sample mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/samples:aspnetapp
```

After the application starts, navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser. You need to navigate to the application via IP address instead of `localhost` for earlier Windows versions, which is demonstrated in [View the ASP.NET app in a running container on Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/dotnet-framework-docker/blob/main/samples/aspnetapp/README.md#view-the-aspnet-app-in-a-running-container-on-windows).

{{ARGS["top-header"]}}# Container sample: Run WCF service and client applications

Type the following command to run a sample WCF service application with Docker:

```console
docker run -it --rm --name wcfservice_sample mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/samples:wcfservice
```

After the container starts, find the IP address of the container instance:

```console
docker inspect --format="@{{.NetworkSettings.Networks.nat.IPAddress@}}" wcfservice_sample
172.26.236.119
```

Type the following Docker command to start a WCF client container, set environment variable HOST to the IP address of the wcfservice_sample container:

```console
docker run --name wcfclient_sample --rm -it -e HOST=172.26.236.119 mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/samples:wcfclient
```
