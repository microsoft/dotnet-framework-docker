## Container sample: Run an ASP.NET application
You can quickly run a container with a pre-built [sample ASP.NET Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-framework-samples/), based on the [ASP.NET Docker sample].

Type the following [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker) command:

```console
docker run --name aspnet_sample --rm -it -p 8000:80 mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/samples:aspnetapp
```

After the application starts, navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser. You need to navigate to the application via IP address instead of `localhost` for earlier Windows versions, which is demonstrated in [View the ASP.NET app in a running container on Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/dotnet-framework-docker/blob/master/samples/aspnetapp/README.md#view-the-aspnet-app-in-a-running-container-on-windows).
